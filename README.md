###Alfred workflow to start / stop your prm projects
-
I created this workflow for personal use but I think that some might find it useful:)

I recently tested prm and I really like it. prm is a minimal project manager for the terminal.

Iâ€™m using prm  after a recommendation from a colleague and I really like it and as I really love Alfred I thought I need to create a workflow for it to get even faster and lazier for the same time switching projects.

This worfklow filters your folders in ~/.prm/ and passes the folder name to a terminal script starting the desired prm project. If you have another location for your prm projects you have to adjust the path inside the script filter.

To stop your current prm project just type prm stop.

If you have any questions or ideas to improve this workflow let me know:) Also let me know if you have any bugs using it.
